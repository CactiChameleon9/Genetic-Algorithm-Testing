# Genetic-Algorithm-Testing

A surprisingly successful attempt at implementing a genetic algorithm in Godot

- "3d Character Walk" Doesn't work, I made a rag doll in the wrong way and so decided to go with something simpler
- "Move Towards Goal" works really well (see the Main scene) and the "bugs" progressively get better at reaching their goal

Next steps would be to add some awareness to the bugs, so they can "understand" and make decisions based on whats around them
